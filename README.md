# classlabworks
This is for my class labworks

Each lab work is in response to lab questions that will be uploaded later in zipped files format.
I use this repo to learn but also get the feel of working in a real collaborative environment.

OOP style was used in lab02 only. From lab03 I used procedural programming style to comply to instructions from our instructor.

Cheers!!
